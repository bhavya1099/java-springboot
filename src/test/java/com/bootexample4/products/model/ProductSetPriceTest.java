"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Positive Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithPositiveValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when a positive value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a positive double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against the passed positive value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when a positive value is passed. The expected result is the same as the input value because the setPrice method should directly set the price to the input value. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the setPrice method.
  Scenario 2: Test for Zero Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithZero.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when zero is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when zero is passed. The expected result is zero as the setPrice method should directly set the price to the input value. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the setPrice method when zero is passed, which is a boundary condition.
  Scenario 3: Test for Negative Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithNegativeValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when a negative value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against the passed negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when a negative value is passed. The expected result is the same as the input value because the setPrice method should directly set the price to the input value. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the setPrice method when negative values are passed, which could be an error condition in some business contexts.
